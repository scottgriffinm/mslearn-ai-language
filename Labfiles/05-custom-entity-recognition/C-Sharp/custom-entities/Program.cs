Provision an Azure AI Language resource
If you don't already have one in your subscription, you'll need to provision an Azure AI Language service resource. Additionally, use custom text classification, you need to enable the Custom text classification & extraction feature.

In a browser, open the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com, and sign in with your Microsoft account.

Select the Create a resource button, search for Language, and create an Azure AI Language Service resource. When asked about Additional features, select Custom text classification & extraction. Create the resource with the following settings:

Subscription: Your Azure subscription
Resource group: Select or create a resource group
Region: Choose any available region
Name: Enter a unique name
Pricing tier: Select F0 (free), or S (standard) if F is not available.
Storage account: New storage account:
Storage account name: Enter a unique name.
Storage account type: Standard LRS
Responsible AI notice: Selected.
Select Review + create, then select Create to provision the resource.

Wait for deployment to complete, and then go to the deployed resource.

View the Keys and Endpoint page. You will need the information on this page later in the exercise.

Upload sample ads
After you've created the Azure AI Language Service and storage account, you'll need to upload example ads to train your model later.

In a new browser tab, download sample classified ads from https://aka.ms/entity-extraction-ads and extract the files to a folder of your choice.

In the Azure portal, navigate to the storage account you created, and select it.

In your storage account select Configuration, located below Settings, and screen enable the option to Allow Blob anonymous access then select Save.

Select Containers from the left menu, located below Data storage. On the screen that appears, select + Container. Give the container the name classifieds, and set Anonymous access level to Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs).

NOTE: When you configure a storage account for a real solution, be careful to assign the appropriate access level. To learn more about each access level, see the Azure Storage documentation.

After creating the container, select it and click the Upload button and upload the sample ads you downloaded.

Create a custom named entity recognition project
Now you're ready to reate a custom named entity recognition project. This project provides a working place to build, train, and deploy your model.

NOTE: You can also create, build, train, and deploy your model through the REST API.

In a new browser tab, open the Azure AI Language Studio portal at https://language.cognitive.azure.com/ and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.

If prompted to choose a Language resource, select the following settings:

Azure Directory: The Azure directory containing your subscription.
Azure subscription: Your Azure subscription.
Resource type: Language.
Language resource: The Azure AI Language resource you created previously.
If you are not prompted to choose a language resource, it may be because you have multiple Language resources in your subscription; in which case:

On the bar at the top if the page, select the Settings (⚙) button.
On the Settings page, view the Resources tab.
Select the language resource you just created, and click Switch resource.
At the top of the page, click Language Studio to return to the Language Studio home page
At the top of the portal, in the Create new menu, select Custom named entity recognition*.

Create a new project with the following settings:

Connect storage: This value is likely already filled. Change it to your storage account if it isn't already
Basic information:
Name: CustomEntityLab
Text primary language: English (US)
Does your dataset include documents that are not in the same language? : No
Description: Custom entities in classified ads
Container:
Blob store container: classifieds
Are your files labeled with classes?: No, I need to label my files as part of this project
Label your data
Now that your project is created, you need to label your data to train your model how to identity entities.

If the Data labeling page is not already open, in the pane on the left, select Data labeling. You'll see a list of the files you uploaded to your storage account.
On the right side, in the Activity pane, select Add entity and add a new entity named ItemForSale.
Repeat the previous stept o create the following entities:
Price
Location
After you've created your three entities, select Ad 1.txt so you can read it.
In Ad 1.txt:
Highlight the text face cord of firewood and select the ItemForSale entity.
Highlight the text Denver, CO and select the Location entity.
Highlight the text $90 and select the Price entity. 1.In the Activity pane, note that this document will be added to the dataset for training the model.
Us the Next document button to move to the next document, and continue assigning text to appropriate entities for the entire set of documents, adding them all to the training dataset.
When you have labeled the last document (Ad 9.txt), save the labels.
Train your model
After you've labeled your data, you need to train your model.

Select Training jobs in the pane on the left.

Select Start a training job

Train a new model named ExtractAds

Choose Automatically split the testing set from training data

TIP: In your own extraction projects, use the testing split that best suits your data. For more consistent data and larger datasets, the Azure AI Language Service will automatically split the testing set by percentage. With smaller datasets, it's important to train with the right variety of possible input documents.

Click Train

IMPORTANT: Training your model can sometimes take several minutes. You'll get a notification when it's complete.

Evaluate your model
In real world applications, it's important to evaluate and improve your model to verify it's performing as you expect. Two pages on the left show you the details of your trained model, and any testing that failed.

Select Model performance on the left side menu, and select your ExtractAds model. There you can see the scoring of your model, performance metrics, and when it was trained. You'll be able to see if any testing documents failed, and these failures help you understand where to improve.

Deploy your model
When you're satisfied with the training of your model, it's time to deploy it, which allows you to start extracting entities through the API.

In the left pane, select Deploying a model.
Select Add deployment, then enter the name AdEntities and select the ExtractAds model.
Click Deploy to deploy your model.
Prepare to develop an app in Visual Studio Code
To test the custom entity extraction capabilities of the Azure AI Language service, you'll develop a simple console application in Visual Studio Code.

Tip: If you have already cloned the mslearn-ai-language repo, open it in Visual Studio code. Otherwise, follow these steps to clone it to your development environment.

Start Visual Studio Code.

Open the palette (SHIFT+CTRL+P) and run a Git: Clone command to clone the https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-language repository to a local folder (it doesn't matter which folder).

When the repository has been cloned, open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

Wait while additional files are installed to support the C# code projects in the repo.

Note: If you are prompted to add required assets to build and debug, select Not Now.

Configure your application
Applications for both C# and Python have been provided, as well as a sample text file you'll use to test the summarization. Both apps feature the same functionality. First, you'll complete some key parts of the application to enable it to use your Azure AI Language resource.

In Visual Studio Code, in the Explorer pane, browse to the Labfiles/05-custom-entity-recognition folder and expand the CSharp or Python folder depending on your language preference and the custom-entities folder it contains. Each folder contains the language-specific files for an app into which you're you're going to integrate Azure AI Language text classification functionality.

Right-click the custom-entities folder containing your code files and open an integrated terminal. Then install the Azure AI Language Text Analytics SDK package by running the appropriate command for your language preference:

C#:

dotnet add package Azure.AI.TextAnalytics --version 5.3.0
Python:

pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.3.0
In the Explorer pane, in the custom-entities folder, open the configuration file for your preferred language

C#: appsettings.json
Python: .env
Update the configuration values to include the endpoint and a key from the Azure Language resource you created (available on the Keys and Endpoint page for your Azure AI Language resource in the Azure portal). The fil should already contain the project and deployment names for your custom entity extraction model.

Save the configuration file.

Test your application
Now your application is ready to test.

In the integrated terminal for the classify-text folder, and enter the following command to run the program:

C#: dotnet run
Python: python custom-entities.py
Tip: You can use the Maximize panel size (^) icon in the terminal toolbar to see more of the console text.

Observe the output. The application should list details of the entities found in each text file.
