Custom text classification
Azure AI Language provides several NLP capabilities, including the key phrase identification, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. The Language service also provides custom features like custom question answering and custom text classification.

To test the custom text classification of the Azure AI Language service, we'll configure the model using Language Studio then use a small command-line application that runs in the Cloud Shell to test it. The same pattern and functionality used here can be followed for real-world applications.

Provision an Azure AI Language resource
If you don't already have one in your subscription, you'll need to provision an Azure AI Language service resource. Additionally, use custom text classification, you need to enable the Custom text classification & extraction feature.

In a browser, open the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com, and sign in with your Microsoft account.

Select the search field at the top of the portal, search for Azure AI services, and create a Language Service resource.

Select the box that includes Custom text classification. Then select Continue to create your resource.

Create a resource with the following settings:

Subscription: Your Azure subscription.
Resource group: Select or create a resource group.
Region: Choose any available region:
Name: Enter a unique name.
Pricing tier: Select F0 (free), or S (standard) if F is not available.
Storage account: New storage account
Storage account name: Enter a unique name.
Storage account type: Standard LRS
Responsible AI notice: Selected.
Select Review + create, then select Create to provision the resource.

Wait for deployment to complete, and then go to the deployed resource.

View the Keys and Endpoint page. You will need the information on this page later in the exercise.

Upload sample articles
Once you've created the Azure AI Language service and storage account, you'll need to upload example articles to train your model later.

In a new browser tab, download sample articles from https://aka.ms/classification-articles and extract the files to a folder of your choice.

In the Azure portal, navigate to the storage account you created, and select it.

In your storage account select Configuration, located below Settings. In the Configuration screen enable the option to Allow Blob anonymous access then select Save.

Select Containers in the left menu, located below Data storage. On the screen that appears, select + Container. Give the container the name articles, and set Anonymous access level to Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs).

NOTE: When you configure a storage account for a real solution, be careful to assign the appropriate access level. To learn more about each access level, see the Azure Storage documentation.

After you've created the container, select it then select the Upload button. Select Browse for files to browse for the sample articles you downloaded. Then select Upload.

Create a custom text classification project
After configuration is complete, create a custom text classification project. This project provides a working place to build, train, and deploy your model.

NOTE: This lab utilizes Language Studio, but you can also create, build, train, and deploy your model through the REST API.

In a new browser tab, open the Azure AI Language Studio portal at https://language.cognitive.azure.com/ and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.

If prompted to choose a Language resource, select the following settings:

Azure Directory: The Azure directory containing your subscription.
Azure subscription: Your Azure subscription.
Resource type: Language.
Language resource: The Azure AI Language resource you created previously.
If you are not prompted to choose a language resource, it may be because you have multiple Language resources in your subscription; in which case:

On the bar at the top if the page, select the Settings (⚙) button.
On the Settings page, view the Resources tab.
Select the language resource you just created, and click Switch resource.
At the top of the page, click Language Studio to return to the Language Studio home page
At the top of the portal, in the Create new menu, select Custom text classification.

The Connect storage page appears. All values will already have been filled. So select Next.

On the Select project type page, select Single label classification. Then select Next.

On the Enter basic information pane, set the following:

Name: ClassifyLab
Text primary language: English (US)
Description: Custom text lab
Select Next.

On the Choose container page, set the Blob store container dropdown to your articles container.

Select the No, I need to label my files as part of this project option. Then select Next.

Select Create project.

Label your data
Now that your project is created, you need to label, or tag, your data to train your model how to classify text.

On the left, select Data labeling, if not already selected. You'll see a list of the files you uploaded to your storage account.

On the right side, in the Activity pane, select + Add class. The articles in this lab fall into four classes you'll need to create: Classifieds, Sports, News, and Entertainment.

Screenshot showing the tag data page and the add class button.

After you've created your four classes, select Article 1 to start. Here you can read the article, define which class this file is, and which dataset (training or testing) to assign it to.

Assign each article the appropriate class and dataset (training or testing) using the Activity pane on the right. You can select a label from the list of labels on the right, and set each article to training or testing using the options at the bottom of the Activity pane. You select Next document to move to the next document. For the purposes of this lab, we'll define which are to be used for training the model and testing the model:

Article	Class	Dataset
Article 1	Sports	Training
Article 10	News	Training
Article 11	Entertainment	Testing
Article 12	News	Testing
Article 13	Sports	Testing
Article 2	Sports	Training
Article 3	Classifieds	Training
Article 4	Classifieds	Training
Article 5	Entertainment	Training
Article 6	Entertainment	Training
Article 7	News	Training
Article 8	News	Training
Article 9	Entertainment	Training
NOTE Files in Language Studio are listed alphabetically, which is why the above list is not in sequential order. Make sure you visit both pages of documents when labeling your articles.

Select Save labels to save your labels.

Train your model
After you've labeled your data, you need to train your model.

Select Training jobs on the left side menu.

Select Start a training job.

Train a new model named ClassifyArticles.

Select Use a manual split of training and testing data.

TIP In your own classification projects, the Azure AI Language service will automatically split the testing set by percentage which is useful with a large dataset. With smaller datasets, it's important to train with the right class distribution.

Select Train

IMPORTANT Training your model can sometimes take several minutes. You'll get a notification when it's complete.

Evaluate your model
In real world applications of text classification, it's important to evaluate and improve your model to verify it's performing as you expect.

Select Model performance, and select your ClassifyArticles model. There you can see the scoring of your model, performance metrics, and when it was trained. If the scoring of your model isn't 100%, it means that one of the documents used for testing didn't evaluate to what it was labeled. These failures can help you understand where to improve.
Select Test set details tab. If there are any errors, this tab allows you to see the articles you indicated for testing and what the model predicted them as and whether that conflicts with their test label. The tab defaults to show incorrect predictions only. You can toggle the Show mismatches only option to see all the articles you indicated for testing and what they each of them predicted as.
Deploy your model
When you're satisfied with the training of your model, it's time to deploy it, which allows you to start classifying text through the API.

On the left panel, select Deploying model.
Select Add deployment, then enter articles in the Create a new deployment name field, and select ClassifyArticles in the Model field.
Select Deploy to deploy your model.
Once your model is deployed, leave that page open. You'll need your project and deployment name in the next step.

Configure your application
Applications for both C# and Python have been provided, as well as a sample text file you'll use to test the summarization. Both apps feature the same functionality. First, you'll complete some key parts of the application to enable it to use your Azure AI Language resource.

In Visual Studio Code, in the Explorer pane, browse to the Labfiles/04-text-classification folder and expand the CSharp or Python folder depending on your language preference and the classify-text folder it contains. Each folder contains the language-specific files for an app into which you're you're going to integrate Azure AI Language text classification functionality.

Right-click the classify-text folder containing your code files and open an integrated terminal. Then install the Azure AI Language Text Analytics SDK package by running the appropriate command for your language preference:

C#:

dotnet add package Azure.AI.TextAnalytics --version 5.3.0
Python:

pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.3.0
In the Explorer pane, in the classify-text folder, open the configuration file for your preferred language

C#: appsettings.json
Python: .env
Update the configuration values to include the endpoint and a key from the Azure Language resource you created (available on the Keys and Endpoint page for your Azure AI Language resource in the Azure portal). The fil should already contain the project and deployment names for your text classification model.

Save the configuration file

Test your application
Now your application is ready to test.

In the integrated terminal for the classify-text folder, and enter the following command to run the program:

C#: dotnet run
Python: python classify-text.py
